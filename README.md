## Hi there, I'm Tatiana! 👋
It's a pleasure to see you on my GitHub.
Not long ago I made up my mind to become a Data Scientist. To achieve this ambitious goal, there is a need for deep knowledge of different fields of Mathematics(algebra), Statistics, Python (including its libraries: Pandas, Numpy, SkLearn), SQL. All that's been mentioned I'm currently studying with SENATOROVAI.
Knowledge of a variety of machine learning techniques (clustering, decision tree learning, artificial neural networks, etc.) and their real-world advantages/drawbacks is received at the University of Artificial Intelligence.

Hope you will find this page useful and will  be glad to follow me.
